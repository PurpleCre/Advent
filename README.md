# Overview

In my journey as a fullstack developer I realized that I need to learn languages that cater to mobile delopment, Kotlin is my first choice, so here's an adventure game written in Kotlin

I wrote a commandline adventure game that utilises most of the core features Kotlin offers. The game itself is a dungeon escape game with enemies and random items in different rooms

My purpose for writing this softwareis to demonstrate the capabilities of Kotlin and to challenge myself at the same time.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used vscode, kotlinc engine, and github for this project

This software is written purely in Kotlin
